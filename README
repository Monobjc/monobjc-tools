Monobjc Tools
=============

This repository contains a set of tools used by the other Monobjc projects:
- A class generator (Monobjc.Generator)
- A general purpose library (Monobjc.Tools)
- A set of NAnt tasks (Monobjc.NAnt)
- A set of MSBuild tasks (Monobjc.MSBuild)

-- Monobjc.Generator --
-----------------------

This project contains the class generator used by the Monobjc Project to provide
the wrappers around Mac OS X frameworks.

The generator crawls the Apple documentation and extracts all the class and
protocol information. Once this information is extracted, the C# wrappers are
generated with full documentation.

The tool can be invoked on the command line.

On Windows, the following command will launch the tool:

    %> MonobjcGenerator.exe

On Unix with Mono installed, the following command will launch the tool:

    %> mono MonobjcGenerator.exe

The tool embed an help that contains the commands and the options.

-- Monobjc.Generator --
-----------------------

This project contains a set of classes used by other Monobjc projects. They provide
object-oriented access to many Mac OS utilities and wraps complex behavior as well
as complex file parsing.

-- Monobjc.NAnt --
-----------------------

This set of tasks is merely a wrapper around the tools to allow their use within
a NAnt script.

-- Monobjc.MSBuild --
-----------------------

This set of tasks is merely a wrapper around the tools to allow their use within
a MSBuild script.
